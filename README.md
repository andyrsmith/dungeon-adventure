# Dungeon Adventure Game

Simple roguelike dungeon crawler game written in C using Raylibs.

So far it is just one build main.c file, but will seperate it in smaller files eventually.

## How to Play

Use the mouse to click on where to move and the player will move to that location.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Raylib installed on your system. Check the Raylib documentation for installation instructions.
2. Run the build command:

   ```bash
   make all
  ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   ./dungeon
   ```
